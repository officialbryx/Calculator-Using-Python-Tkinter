# Calculator-using-python-tkinter

# So I made this simple calculator, I created a simple one and I wanted the style to look like Microsoft Calculator but I'll try to keep improving it once I've become a better programmer.

# I based my calculator on the youtube tutorial Title: Calculator with GUI Using Python Tkinter (Less Than 200 lines of Code) (Link:'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZPv1y2znZo')

# I tweaked some of it in order to make it look like Microsoft Calculator.
